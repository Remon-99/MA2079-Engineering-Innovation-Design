<h1>MA2079 Engineering Innovation Design: Award-Winning Self-Disinfecting Toilet Bowl</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the MA2079 Engineering Innovation & Design module, our team crafted an innovative self-disinfecting toilet. My
responsibility involved programming an Arduino with C++ to automate the cleaning process. Using ultrasonic sensors, the
system is able to detect inactivity, triggering a precise disinfection routine with the usage of hydro pumps and
disinfectants. Our project was highly successful and secured the first prize in the NTU Engineering Innovation and Design
Competition.
